The command line interface (CLI) allows users to submit their project package dependencies to [Phylum's](https://phylum.io) API for analysis. Currently [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/phylum-dev/cli/releases) for Linux and macOS are available. On Windows, we recommend using the Linux binaries under [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). For more options, see [Alternate Installation Methods](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/alternate_install).

## Extensions

Phylum CLI extensions allow you to extend the existing CLI functionality with
new features. You can start exploring by taking a look at the official Phylum
extensions:

<https://github.com/phylum-dev/cli/tree/main/extensions>

### How-tos

How-to articles for the extension framework can be found [here](https://dev.to/phylum).

## musl binaries

As of version 3.8.0, the provided Linux binaries of the Phylum CLI depend on
`glibc`. We no longer provide binaries that are statically compiled with the
`musl` libc.

This means the provided binaries won't be executable in environments such as
Alpine Linux. If your use case requires a lightweight Docker base image,
consider using [Debian slim][debian-slim] instead.
