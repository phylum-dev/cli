# Phylum pip extension

A [Phylum CLI][phylum-cli] extension that checks your [pip] dependencies through
[Phylum][phylum] before installing them.

## Installation

This is a pre-installed extension and may be available without any additional
action. If, for some reason, this extension is not already available, follow
these steps to install it:

Clone the repository and install the extension via the Phylum CLI.

```console
git clone https://github.com/phylum-dev/cli
phylum extension install cli/extensions/pip
```

## Requirements

This extension requires `pip` version 23.0 or greater (for the `--dry-run` and
`--report` flags). Check your version with `pip --version` and upgrade if
necessary with `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

## Basic usage

Prepend `phylum` to your `pip` command invocations:

```console
phylum pip install my-package  # This will be checked by Phylum!
```

Or set up an alias in your shell to make it transparent:

```console
alias pip="phylum pip"
pip install my-package  # This will be checked by Phylum!
```

## How it works

When invoking `phylum pip`, subcommands that would install new packages trigger
a Phylum analysis.

- If the analysis is successful, the corresponding changes will be applied.
- If the analysis is unsuccessful because some of the new dependencies don't
  meet the required project thresholds, the command will fail.
- If the analysis is waiting for Phylum to process one or more of the submitted
  packages, the command will fail and the changes will _not_ be applied.
- Commands that do not install any dependencies will be passed through to `pip`
  directly.
