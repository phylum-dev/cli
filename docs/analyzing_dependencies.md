After setting up a Phylum [project](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/create_project), you can begin analysis by running:

```sh
phylum analyze
```

The default response will provide an overall summary result to indicate whether the [project's established policy](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/policy) has been met. If there are still packages being processed, an incomplete status will be indicated. Any policy violations will be reported, along with a link to the complete report.

```shellsession
❯ phylum analyze
✅ Successfully parsed dependency file "requirements.txt" as type "pip"
✅ Successfully parsed dependency file "package-lock.json" as type "npm"
✅ Job ID: 3accba15-b0dc-43d2-b8ce-f5700360e3bd

```

If you prefer JSON formatted output, you can leverage the `--json` flag.

```sh
phylum analyze --json > output.json
```

If the analysis fails the project's policy, the command's exit code will be set to `100`.
