The Phylum command line interface (CLI) allows users to submit their project package dependencies to [Phylum's](https://phylum.io) API for analysis. Currently [pre-built binaries](https://github.com/phylum-dev/cli/releases) for Linux and macOS are available. On Windows, we recommend using the Linux binaries under [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). See the [alternate installation methods](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/alternate_install) for more options.

## Install `phylum` CLI

### Install on Linux

Install on Linux with the following command:

### Install on macOS

On macOS, we recommend installing phylum with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh

> **Note:** When using Homebrew, [official extensions][] must be installed separately.
