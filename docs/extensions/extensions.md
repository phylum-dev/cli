Phylum CLI extensions are optional plugins for the CLI which provide additional
functionality in a modular fashion.

Extensions are executed in a Deno JavaScript runtime and have access to Phylum's
API for commonly used operations. The capability-based permission system,
together with Deno's sandbox, ensures that extensions can only do what they're
supposed to.

## Usage

If you're interested in using existing Phylum CLI extensions, you can take a
look at the [CLI's extension documentation].
