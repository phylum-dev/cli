## Overview

Phylum CLI extensions are optional plugins for the CLI which provide additional
functionality in a modular fashion.

Extensions are executed in a [Deno] JavaScript runtime and have access to
Phylum's API for commonly used operations. The capability-based permission
system, together with Deno's sandbox, ensures that extensions can only do what
they're supposed to.

[Deno]: https://deno.land/

## Usage

If you're interested in using existing Phylum CLI extensions, you can take a
