If a new version of the Phylum binaries are released, you will get a message notifying you of this fact above the output of any `phylum` runs.

## Updating from version 1.2.0 or earlier
Older versions of the Phylum CLI must be updated manually. Attempting to use `phylum update` will result in an error.

To update to the latest release, follow the [quickstart instructions](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/quickstart#quickstart-for-linux-or-macos)
for a fresh install. There is no need to uninstall the old version first. The installer will correctly perform the update.

## Updating with version 2.0.0 and newer
For newer versions of the Phylum CLI, updating to the latest binary is as simple as:

```sh
phylum update
```
