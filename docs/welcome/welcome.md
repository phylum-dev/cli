#### Phylum provides a comprehensive, scalable approach to defending your software supply chain. Get started with one or all of the below capabilities.

# Detect & Prevent

_Analyze risks and block threats from entering source code._

- [Create a new Phylum project](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/phylum_project_create) in your project directory (`phylum project create <project-name>`)
- [Submit your package lock file](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/phylum_analyze) (`phylum analyze <package-lock-file.ext>`)
- (Optional) View the analysis results in the [Phylum UI](https://app.phylum.io/auth/login)
- https://blog.phylum.io/insights-and-resources/pick-a-python-lockfile-and-improve-security

## Analyze Your First Project

### Download and Install the Phylum CLI

The Phylum CLI is available for a [variety of operating systems on GitHub](https://github.com/phylum-dev/cli/releases/latest). However, you can easily install the CLI with the following:
```sh
curl <https://sh.phylum.io> | sh
```
![Install Phylum](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phylum-dev/cli/main/assets/install-cli.webp)

Once installed, authenticate your local development environment by running:
```sh
phylum auth login
```
![Login](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phylum-dev/cli/main/assets/cli-login.webp)

### Create a New Phylum Project
All analysis jobs *_must_* be associated with a Phylum project. To create a project, run the following:
```sh
phylum project create <projectName>
```
![Create Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phylum-dev/cli/main/assets/create-project.webp)

### Analyze a Project
To begin analyzing your project for software supply chain risks, submit a lockfile to Phylum.
```sh
phylum analyze <lockfile>
```
![Analyze Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phylum-dev/cli/main/assets/submit-job.webp)

### View Results
After submitting your project, view the results in the [web UI](https://app.phylum.io).

# Defend Developers
### (See results in less than 5 minutes)
_Defend your developers and workstations from malicious code and prevent the theft of SSH keys. Block suspect open-source containers automatically by leveraging Phylum Bird Cage (Sandbox) and pre-install checks._
![Pre-Install Checks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phylum-dev/cli/main/assets/compare.webp)

- _Contained in the Phylum CLI:_
- Phylum allows you to defend your developers by running pre-install checks, shown in the video above.
- Safely quarantine packages during install with [Phylum Sandbox (Birdcage)](https://github.com/phylum-dev/birdcage), which will restrict access to the filesystem, network, and environment variables.
  - Put these tools into action by running: `phylum npm install`

# Extensions
_Advance your OSS security by deploying your own extensions in the Phylum CLI (1-2 mins)_

- [Extension Quickstart](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/extension_quickstart)
- Generate your own extension skeleton
  - `phylum extension new my-extension`
  - Extensions always contain at least two files, the manifest describing the
extension (PhylumExt.toml), and the entrypoint where the extension's execution will begin. Any additional source files can be included in the extension directory and imported from the entrypoint.
  - The manifest file contains metadata about the extension beyond its executable source code. This allows you to define allowed resources in the sandboxed runtime. All available options can be found in the manifest format.
