The Phylum CLI natively supports processing the lock/requirements files for several ecosystems, namely:
* npm
    * `package-lock.json`
    * `yarn.lock` (Version 1 + 2)
* RubyGems
    * `Gemfile.lock`
* PyPI
    * `requirements.txt`
    * `Pipfile.lock`
    * `Pipfile`
    * `poetry.lock` (Version 1 + 2)
* NuGet
    * `*.csproj`
* Maven
    * `effective-pom.xml`
    * `gradle.lockfile`
* Golang
    * `go.sum`
* Cargo
    * `Cargo.lock`

After setting up a Phylum [project](https://docs.phylum.io/docs/phylum_project) , you can begin analysis by running:

```sh
phylum analyze <package-lock-file.ext>
```

The default response will provide you with a high-level overview of your packages, including the total project score, score distributions across all packages, whether or not this analysis was a pass or fail and the total number of packages still processing.

```
$ phylum analyze package-lock.json

```

You can get more detailed output from the analysis, to include specific issues and their severity, by using the `--verbose` flag:

```sh
phylum analyze --verbose <package-lock-file.ext>
```

If you prefer JSON formatted output, you can leverage the `--json` flag.

```sh
phylum analyze --verbose --json <package-lock-file.ext> > output.json
```

If the analysis failed to meet the project's thresholds, the command's exit code will be set to `100`.
