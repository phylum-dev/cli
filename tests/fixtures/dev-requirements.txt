# This is an example of a pip manifest file that does not fit the expected naming convention of:
#
# requirements*.txt
#
# Pip manifest files can be named *anything* and they are therefore hard to identify.
# Pip lockfiles can also be named *anything* but they will at least get picked up
# by the fallback approach of attempting to parse with all known parsers (assuming
# a "true" lockfile with no loose requirement entries).
